Compare in terms of latency, cost, scalability between the public (ethereum) and private (hyperledger fabric)

Latency:
1) For latency, block generation time through one system & end to end.
2) Variation of block generation time / hashing difficutly / number of nodes that can be supported in ethereum

Cost:
1) Cost analysis for deploying ethereum smart contract
2) Based on use cases and frequency

Authorization / Workflow:
1) How to share smart contracts between the devices and the entire workflow? 
2) Where should the logic reside? On the server or the contract. Server has the benefit of ease of change. 

Complexity for implementation:
1) Similar in terms of implementing an API vs smart contracts

Benefits of blockchain over central coordinator:
1) No single power over an entity. 
2) Need complete trust

1) Accountability
2) Causality
3) Transparency
